A simple program that will create a spreadsheet that has all the spins you enter, and keeps a running total for you.

All you have to do is put in the positional reference number of the spin and the program will log it and do the math about running total

This is a pretty lightweight program, and as of yet I have not even tested it, but it shouldn't run with any problems

Also, I literally haven't run it myself yet while playing rust so I'm not sure how it will interact with EAC. 

Hopefully I get to updating this a bit more and hopefully it helps you record data a little bit more efficiently.
